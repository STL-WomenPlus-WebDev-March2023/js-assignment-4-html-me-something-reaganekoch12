      <h1>Travels to France</h1>
      <h1 id="mainHeading">Paris</h1>
      <p>
        In early May, I went on a trip to Bordeaux, France. Getting over there was definitely not easy. The citizens of France were going on organized strikes because the retirement age was raised by two years. Our flights were getting canceled on the way in. We were finally able to get a flight leaving from New York and flying into Paris. The plane ran out of gas on the way over, so we had to land in Philadelphia. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Paris. We had to find a flight the next day out of Raleigh. On this flight, there was a medical emergency, so we were waiting to take off for two hours. This caused us to miss our flight from Paris to Bordeauxâ€¦ Eventually, we made it to Bordeaux, but we were two days late.
