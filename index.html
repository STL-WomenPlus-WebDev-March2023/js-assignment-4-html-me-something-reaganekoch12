      <h1>Travels to France</h1>
      <h1 id="mainHeading">Paris</h1>
      <p>
        In early May, I went on a trip to Bordeaux, France. Getting over there was definitely not easy. The citizens of France were going on organized strikes because the retirement age was raised by two years. Our flights were getting canceled on the way in. We were finally able to get a flight leaving from New York and flying into Paris. The plane ran out of gas on the way over, so we had to land in Philadelphia. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Paris. We had to find a flight the next day out of Raleigh. On this flight, there was a medical emergency, so we were waiting to take off for two hours. This caused us to miss our flight from Paris to Bordeauxâ€¦ Eventually, we made it to Bordeaux, but we were two days late.

      <h2>What I Packed While on Vacation</h2>
      <p>Packing is an important part of travel. Costa Rica was definitely hard to pack for since it was hot there but cold at home. France was not as difficult to pack for because the weather was extremely similar to Saint Louis, so I was not having to go into my storage to get any new outfits. Some essentials that I packed for Costa Rica included swimsuits, aloe vera, and sunglasses. Some essaisl that I packed for France was a rain jacket, slacks, and comfortable walking shoes. I definitely had to look into each location to see what was smart to add.</p>

      <h2>How I am planning on traveling in the future. </h2>
      <p>To save money, I am definitley going to have to stay in hostels. I will not be able to stay in Airbnbs the entire time. I definitely want to do everything I can to travel as much as possible, so I have to save a certain amount of money each month to do that. </p>

      <h2>How I Book the Most Afforable Flights</h2>
      <p> I definitely only book flights on Tuesday and later at night. I do not want to book flights at a busier time, becuase they will be much more expensive. </p>
