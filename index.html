      <h1>Travels to France</h1>
      <h1 id="mainHeading">Paris</h1>
      <p>
        In early May, I went on a trip to Bordeaux, France. Getting over there was definitely not easy. The citizens of France were going on organized strikes because the retirement age was raised by two years. Our flights were getting canceled on the way in. We were finally able to get a flight leaving from New York and flying into Paris. The plane ran out of gas on the way over, so we had to land in Philadelphia. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Paris. We had to find a flight the next day out of Raleigh. On this flight, there was a medical emergency, so we were waiting to take off for two hours. This caused us to miss our flight from Paris to Bordeauxâ€¦ Eventually, we made it to Bordeaux, but we were two days late.

      <h2>What I Packed While on Vacation</h2>
      <p>Packing is an important part of travel. Costa Rica was definitely hard to pack for since it was hot there but cold at home. France was not as difficult to pack for because the weather was extremely similar to Saint Louis, so I was not having to go into my storage to get any new outfits. Some essentials that I packed for Costa Rica included swimsuits, aloe vera, and sunglasses. Some essentaisl that I packed for France was a rain jacket, slacks, and comfortable walking shoes. I definitely had to look into each location to see what was smart to add. </p>

        <p> I definitely plan on traveling more within the next couple of years. I have a trip to Italy planned for Thanksgiving. During this trip, I will be going to Rome, Florence, and Venice. Next summer, I plan on backpacking through Europe. I want to go to as many countries as I possibly can. </p>
